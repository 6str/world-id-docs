:::note
The continuity grant is in beta. This means we're very flexible if you have something else in mind.

**A continuity grant is a great way to carry on work from a hackathon or in general any MVP work built on top of World ID**. This grants is also offered to integrate World ID into existing projects. Applying for this grant is very easy (it'll involve a short conversation on Discord and setting specific goals to accomplish) and we have a very fast turnaround response. Currently this grant is offered for **up to ðŸ¤‘ $3,500 USD**, payable in USDC.

:::info
This grant is generally intended to take MVP products to production or do straightforward integrations on existing projects. If you have a bigger project in mind, **please [reach out](https://discord.gg/worldcoin)**, we are happy to discuss a different kind of grant.
